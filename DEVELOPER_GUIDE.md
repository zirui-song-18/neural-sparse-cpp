# Developer Guide

So you want to contribute code to neural-sparse-cpp? Excellent! We're glad you're here. Here's what you need to do.

## Getting Started

### Fork neural-sparse-cpp Repo

Fork [opensearch-project/neural-sparse-cpp](https://github.com/opensearch-project/neural-sparse-cpp) and clone locally.

Example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your username]/neural-sparse-cpp.git
```

### Install Prerequisites

#### C++ Compiler and Build Tools

neural-sparse-cpp requires C++20 and uses CMake as its build system. You will need:

- A C++20 compatible compiler (with OpenMP support version 2 or higher), such as GCC 11+, Clang 14+, or MSVC 2022+
- CMake 3.15 or higher
- OpenMP
- SWIG (only if building Python bindings)

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y g++ cmake libomp-dev swig libabsl-dev
```

**macOS**
```bash
brew install cmake libomp swig abseil
```

> Note: [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) is an optional system dependency. If not found, CMake will automatically fetch it from GitHub during the build.

#### Python (Optional)

If you plan to build or use the Python bindings, you will also need:

- Python 3.8+ with development headers
- pip

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**
```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-dev python3-pip
```

> Note: Replace `python3-dev` with your specific version package (e.g., `python3.12-dev`) if needed.

## Build

Configure and build the project using CMake:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j
```

### Build Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NSPARSE_OPT_LEVEL` | `generic` | SIMD optimization level |
| `NSPARSE_ENABLE_PYTHON` | `OFF` | Build Python bindings |
| `NSPARSE_ENABLE_TESTS` | `OFF` | Build unit tests |
| `NSPARSE_ENABLE_BENCHMARKS` | `OFF` | Build benchmarks |
| `NSPARSE_ENABLE_GPU` | `OFF` | GPU-accelerate index building via cuSPARSE (see [GPU Acceleration](#gpu-acceleration)) |
| `NSPARSE_ENABLE_SANITIZERS` | `OFF` | Build with ASan and UBSan (see [Sanitizers](#sanitizers)) |

Example with multiple options:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DNSPARSE_ENABLE_TESTS=ON -DNSPARSE_OPT_LEVEL=avx2
cmake --build build -j
```

### SIMD Optimization Levels

The `NSPARSE_OPT_LEVEL` option controls which SIMD instruction sets are compiled:

| Value | Architecture | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `generic` | Any | No SIMD specialization (default) |
| `avx2` | x86_64 | AVX2 + FMA + F16C + POPCNT |
| `avx512` | x86_64 | AVX-512 (F, CD, VL, DQ, BW) + AVX2 |
| `sve` | ARM (non-Apple) | Scalable Vector Extension |

> Note: ARM NEON is used automatically on ARM platforms. SVE is not supported on Apple Silicon.

### GPU Acceleration

`NSPARSE_ENABLE_GPU=ON` compiles optional NVIDIA GPU acceleration for the
**index-building** (`build()`) path of `SeismicIndex`, using cuSPARSE plus a few
custom CUDA kernels. This offloads the two heaviest build phases — the k-means
document→centroid assignment and the `summarize()` per-term max-pool. Search is
unaffected and always runs on the CPU. The option is `OFF` by default, so
CPU-only builds and platforms without a CUDA toolkit are unaffected.

Requirements:

- NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (nvcc, cuSPARSE, cudart) and a CUDA-capable GPU
- `float` (`U32`) weights — quantized (`seismic_sq`) indices fall back to the CPU

Build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DNSPARSE_ENABLE_GPU=ON
cmake --build build -j
```

If the CUDA toolkit is in a non-standard location (for example, a pip-packaged
`nvidia-cu*` wheel), point CMake at it:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DNSPARSE_ENABLE_GPU=ON \
  -DNSPARSE_CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT=/path/to/nvidia/cuXX
```

Target GPU architectures default to `80;89` (Ampere / Ada); override with
`-DNSPARSE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=...`. When built with GPU support and a device is
present, assignment is offloaded unconditionally. The `summarize()` max-pool
offload is opt-in via the `NSPARSE_GPU_SUMMARIZE=1` environment variable; the
default keeps summarize on the CPU, which is faster on high-core hosts and
produces identical output. The GPU build wiring lives in
[`nsparse/gpu/CMakeLists.txt`](nsparse/gpu/CMakeLists.txt).

## Run Tests

Build with tests enabled and run:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DNSPARSE_ENABLE_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

To run specific test suites using GoogleTest filters:

```bash
./build/tests/nsparse_test --gtest_filter="SparseVectors*"
./build/tests/nsparse_test --gtest_filter="SeismicIndex*"
```

### Python integration tests

`python_tests/` holds black-box tests that drive the library the way a user of
the Python bindings does: only what SWIG exposes, with no access to internals.
They complement the GoogleTest suite rather than duplicating it -- the C++ tests
cover the internals SWIG deliberately hides (`MmapCursor`, borrowing
`map_vectors` views, in-memory `BufferedIOWriter` round-trips).

They need the bindings built and installed:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DNSPARSE_ENABLE_PYTHON=ON
cmake --build build -j
pip install "numpy<2.0" pytest
pip install --no-deps build/nsparse/python
pytest python_tests -v
```

One file per index type, named after the use case being exercised
(`test_happy_case`, `test_with_id_map`, `test_exact_match`, ...). Accuracy is
checked against an independent numpy brute-force oracle in
`python_tests/oracle.py`: exact indexes must match it outright, approximate ones
must clear a recall floor.

Seismic builds are nondeterministic by default -- every posting list draws fresh
entropy for its initial centroids -- so keep recall floors loose. Add `seed=` to
the factory description when a test needs the build to reproduce itself:

```python
nsparse.index_factory(dim, "seismic,lambda=25|beta=4|alpha=0.4|seed=42")
```

A seeded build is also independent of `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, because each list's
seed is derived from its own index rather than from the order OpenMP happens to
schedule the lists in.

`test_threading.py` runs each case under several `OMP_NUM_THREADS` values in
subprocesses, which is required because the OpenMP runtime reads that variable
when it initialises.

### Sanitizers

`NSPARSE_ENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON` instruments the whole build with AddressSanitizer
and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. This matters most for the index-file readers: the
negative-path tests assert that a truncated or corrupt file raises an exception,
but only a sanitizer can tell you no out-of-bounds read, overflow or misaligned
access happened on the way to that exception.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DNSPARSE_ENABLE_TESTS=ON -DNSPARSE_ENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build -j
UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1 ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

GCC and Clang only; you need the matching runtimes (`libasan`/`libubsan`, part of
`gcc` on Debian/Ubuntu, separate packages on Amazon Linux and RHEL). Findings
abort the process rather than print and continue, so any one of them fails the
test that hit it. `-DNSPARSE_SANITIZERS=<list>` overrides the default
`address,undefined` for a different `-fsanitize` set, e.g. `thread`.

Under GCC, the `null` check and the two nonnull-attribute checks are dropped:
they make the address of a function template instantiation non-constant, which
breaks abseil's `constexpr` hash-function dispatch in every translation unit that
includes `flat_hash_map`. A null dereference still shows up, as an ASan SEGV
report.

This runs per-PR in CI at the `generic` optimization level. The per-ISA
`distance_kernel_equivalence_test` binaries are built and run at every
optimization level, so that one configuration also covers the SIMD kernels.

## Run Benchmarks

Build with benchmarks enabled and run:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DNSPARSE_ENABLE_BENCHMARKS=ON
cmake --build build -j
./build/benchmarks/nsparse_benchmark
```

On Linux, the benchmarks support hardware performance counters via [libpfm](http://perfmon2.sourceforge.net/). Install `libpfm4-dev` to enable this.

## Building an index larger than memory

A whole-corpus build holds two intermediates that scale with the corpus's
non-zeros — the inverted lists (every posting) and then the clustered posting
lists — so peak memory scales with the corpus, and a corpus whose posting lists
do not fit in RAM cannot be indexed at all.

Batching splits the term space into contiguous windows and finishes one window
before starting the next. It is a build option on the seismic family rather than
a separate entry point, so it is set in the factory description alongside
`lambda` and `beta`, and every type in the family gets it — `seismic`,
`seismic_sq`, `disk_seismic`, `disk_seismic_sq`:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `inverted_list_batch_size=N` | Build in `N` term windows, bounding the inverted-list intermediate to one window. Ignored without `batch_file_output_path`: the clustered lists would accumulate for the whole corpus anyway, so the peak would barely move while the build paid a corpus pass per window. |
| `batch_file_output_path=P` | An existing directory the build may spill windows into. With `N > 1`, each window's clustered lists are written there and freed as they are produced, then borrowed back by mapping the spill, so the clustered lists are never all resident either. Unused at `N <= 1`, which is an ordinary build with nothing to spill. |

So both together or neither: either knob alone leaves an ordinary whole-corpus
build.

`P` is scratch, not output. `build()` writes no index and leaves nothing in that
directory — the spill is unlinked as soon as it is mapped, and the lists go on
being read from the mapping — so serializing an index is still `write_index`'s
job, and the index it writes is byte-for-byte what a whole-corpus build would
have produced.

```cpp
auto* index = nsparse::index_factory(
    dimension,
    "seismic,lambda=6000|beta=400|alpha=0.4"
    "|inverted_list_batch_size=10|batch_file_output_path=/scratch");

// Corpus residency is SparseVectors' business, not the build's: read_csr can
// map a native-layout CSR instead of copying it, and the build is unchanged.
index->read_csr("corpus.mcsr", nsparse::Residency::kMmap);
index->build();   // one window at a time, spilling to /scratch

// Serialized the ordinary way, from the lists the build ended holding.
nsparse::write_index(index, "/data/index.dat");

// And servable as it stands: the posting lists are borrowed from the spill's
// mapping, and the corpus is still borrowed from its own.
index->search(...);
```

The same from Python, since it is only a description string:

```python
native = nsparse.native_path("corpus.csr")
nsparse.convert("corpus.csr", native)
index = nsparse.index_factory(
    dim,
    "seismic,lambda=6000|beta=400|alpha=0.4"
    "|inverted_list_batch_size=10|batch_file_output_path=/scratch",
)
index.read_csr(native, nsparse.Residency_kMmap)
index.build()                                  # spills to /scratch
nsparse.write_index(index, "/data/index.dat")  # the index file, as usual
dists, labels = index.search(n, indptr, indices, values, k)
```

That the two are the same index is asserted rather than assumed: at a fixed
`seed` a batched build and a whole-corpus one are compared as files, for all four
types. Each posting list's k-means seed comes from its own *global* term id and
`lambda`/`beta` are resolved once from the whole corpus, so the window count
cannot change what is produced.

What the spill does cost is disk while the index lives: an unlinked file still
occupies its blocks until the last mapping of it goes, so budget the clustered
lists' size on that filesystem for as long as the index object is around, on top
of whatever `write_index` then writes.

### Choosing `inverted_list_batch_size`

Windows are cut to equal estimated *memory*, not equal width. Term frequencies are
heavily skewed, and peak memory is set by the largest window, so an uneven split
wastes most of what batching could save.

A window has two memory peaks and the split has to weigh both. Filling it holds
every posting of its terms; clustering it holds what survives pruning
(`min(count, lambda)` per term) as clusters and summaries, an order of magnitude
bulkier per posting. Weighting either phase alone unbalances the other, both worse
than weighting their sum — see `make_windows` in `nsparse/seismic_common.cpp`.

That ratio is also why the window count does nothing on its own: it bounds the
fill, and the clustered lists — the bulkier peak — are what a spill directory
bounds.

`RssAnon` is the figure to watch, being what the process itself allocated;
`RssFile` is pages it touched of a mapping, which the kernel can reclaim under
pressure. Read as total RSS the win looks far smaller than it is: an index that
maps its corpus, and then maps its spill back, keeps most of its residency in page
cache, which total RSS counts and pressure reclaims. Batching moves the anonymous
column, so report the split rather than the total.

What to expect from the shape of it: anonymous memory falls faster than 1/N,
because the split comes from the real per-term costs rather than from term ids,
and build time is flat to around ten windows and then climbs, because every window
makes its own pass over the corpus. Ten to twenty windows is usually the useful
range — most of the memory saving for a few percent of build time. The floor is
what the build cannot batch: one window plus whatever the corpus itself costs.

All four types behave alike here, since they share the build. What differs is what
`write_index` then costs them: the disk-resident pair's inline forward index copies
every pruned posting's whole doc vector, so at a large `lambda` that section alone
can dwarf the rest of the index. And `disk_seismic_sq` cannot map a float CSR (it
searches over codes), so its corpus stays on the heap and shows up in the same
column the build's own growth does; subtract the reported `start_rss_anon_mb`.

Borrowing the lists back from the spill is nearly free in the column that matters:
it costs a fraction of a second and single-digit megabytes of anonymous memory,
against copying them, which costs their whole size — the cursor reads the size
header before each array and skips the bulk, so it faults in part of the file as
reclaimable page cache. That mapping is separate from the corpus's: an index that
mapped its corpus with `read_csr` keeps doing so, since it still scores from it.

Compare like with like. A build that loads the corpus is not comparable to one
that maps it, and the difference is more than the corpus: a streaming ingest
stages a second copy that the allocator retains rather than returning to the OS,
so do not read a heap figure and a mapped figure as differing by a fixed offset.
Measure from the start of the build with the corpus already resident, or a
whole-process high-water mark reports the loader and hides everything below it.
Peak RSS comes from `VmHWM`, a kernel counter; the anon and file peaks have no
such counter and are sampled, so they are lower bounds and can disagree with
`VmHWM` by a hair.

Query performance does not move, because the index is the same index: identical
byte for byte at a fixed seed, and indistinguishable in latency, QPS and recall
for the random-seeded default.

Point the spill directory at a real disk. On a tmpfs such as `/tmp` it is RAM,
which defeats the point.

### Measuring it

`benchmarks/batched_build_mem_bench` reports peak RSS (`VmHWM`) and wall time for
one configuration per process — `google-benchmark` measures throughput, and a
high-water mark is only clean in a process that has built nothing else. It times
`build()` alone; the index is written afterwards, outside the measurement, only to
report its size. Use `inmem` to compare against `baseline`: both then hold the
corpus on the heap, so the difference is the batching rather than the residency.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DNSPARSE_ENABLE_BENCHMARKS=ON && cmake --build build -j
B=./build/benchmarks/batched_build_mem_bench
$B convert corpus.csr corpus.mcsr
$B baseline corpus.csr 6000 400 0.4                  # whole-corpus build, for reference
$B batched inmem corpus.csr 6000 400 0.4 10 /scratch # 10 windows, same corpus residency
$B batched mmap corpus.mcsr 6000 400 0.4 10 /scratch # ... or with the corpus mapped

# Any type in the family, as its factory name. Both arms need it, and the
# baseline's index path is positional -- pass "" to skip writing one.
$B baseline corpus.csr 6000 400 0.4 "" disk_seismic
$B batched mmap corpus.mcsr 6000 400 0.4 10 /scratch disk_seismic
```

## Submitting Changes

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Code Guidelines

### File and class names

Class names should use `CamelCase`. File names should use `snake_case`.

Header files use the `.h` extension and source files use `.cpp`.

Try to put new classes into existing directories if the directory name abstracts the purpose of the class. The project is organized as follows:

- `nsparse/` — Core library (index types, sparse vectors, inverted index)
- `nsparse/cluster/` — Clustering algorithms (k-means, inverted list clusters)
- `nsparse/invlists/` — Inverted list storage
- `nsparse/io/` — Serialization and I/O
- `nsparse/utils/` — Utilities (distance functions, SIMD, quantization, ranker)
- `nsparse/gpu/` — Optional CUDA/cuSPARSE build-time acceleration (`NSPARSE_ENABLE_GPU`)
- `nsparse/python/` — Python bindings (SWIG)

### Modular code

Organize code into small classes and methods with a single concise purpose. Prefer multiple small methods over a single long one that does everything.

### Documentation

Document your code. That includes the purpose of new classes, every public method, and code sections that have critical or non-trivial logic.

Use C++ style comments:
```cpp
/**
 * Brief description of the class/method.
 *
 * @param name Description of parameter
 * @return Description of return value
 */
```

### Code style

The project uses [Google C++ Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) as a base with 4-space indentation, configured via `.clang-format`:

```
BasedOnStyle: Google
IndentWidth: 4
AccessModifierOffset: -4
```

Additional conventions:
1. Use descriptive names for classes, methods, fields, and variables.
2. Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely accepted.
3. Use `const` wherever possible.
4. Prefer smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) over raw pointers for ownership.
5. Use `override` on all overridden virtual methods.
6. SWIG `.i` files are excluded from formatting (see `.clang-format-ignore`).

### Style and Formatting Check

The project uses `clang-format` for code formatting and `clang-tidy` for static analysis.

To format code:
```bash
# Format a single file
clang-format -i nsparse/index.cpp

# Format all source files
find nsparse -name '*.cpp' -o -name '*.h' | xargs clang-format -i
```

To run static analysis:
```bash
# Run clang-tidy on a single file (requires compile_commands.json)
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
clang-tidy -p build nsparse/index.cpp
```

The `.clang-tidy` configuration enables checks from `bugprone-*`, `modernize-*`, `performance-*`, and `readability-*` categories.

### Tests

Write unit tests for your new functionality using GoogleTest. Tests live in the `tests/` directory with the naming convention `<module>_test.cpp`.

Unit tests are preferred as they are fast and cheap. Try to cover all possible combinations of parameters.

If your change alters what the Python bindings expose or how an index behaves end to end, add a black-box case to `python_tests/` as well. See [Python integration tests](#python-integration-tests).

If your changes could affect backward compatibility, please include relevant tests along with your PR.

### Index file format

Every serialized index starts with a fixed header (`nsparse::IndexHeader` in `nsparse/io/io.h`). It is written and parsed centrally, by `write_header`/`read_header` in `nsparse/io/index_io.cpp` — an index type never reads its own header, it receives the already-parsed one:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | `uint32` | fourcc of the index type, e.g. `SEIS` |
| version | `uint32` | layout revision of the payload that follows |
| dimension | `int32` | |

The payload follows immediately, and its layout is the index type's own business. A type parses it in `read_index` (copying), `mmap_index` (borrowed from a file mapping), or both — `DiskSeismicIndex` is mmap-only and its `read_index` just throws, while `IDMapIndex` has no `mmap_index` at all and instead threads `io_flags` down to its delegate.

Versions are numbered **per index type**, not per file: `IndexIO::format_version()` returns the type's own `kFormatVersion`, so revising one type's payload leaves the others' numbering alone. An `IDMapIndex` writes its own header for the id map and then a second, complete header for the delegate it wraps, each with its own version.

The same central code rejects a version outside `1..format_version()` before dispatching to either parse path — a file from a newer build fails with a clear error instead of consuming whatever its fields happen to align with.

To change a payload layout:

1. Bump that type's `kFormatVersion`.
2. Branch on `header.version` wherever that type actually parses its payload — its `read_index` and/or its `mmap_index` — keeping the older branch so existing files still load.
3. Add a round-trip test for the new version and a test that reads the old layout.

### Outdated or irrelevant code

Do not submit code that is not used or needed, even if it's commented. We rely on GitHub as a version control system; code can be restored if needed.
